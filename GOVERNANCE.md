This project ("A People's History of Tech: The Mobile Phone") is managed by [(m)otherboard](https://m.otherboard.org), in accordance with its [governance structure](https://m.otherboard.org/governance/). We strive to center the [Ethical Source Principles](https://ethicalsource.dev/principles/) in all the work we do and the decisions we make.

## Decision-making

### Lazy consensus
Technical decisions are made in public through comments on pull requests or issues on our Github repository. These decisions are considered approved in the absence of objections from community leaders or members. Major decisions may require waiting an appropriate period of time for community review before changes are committed.

### Committee responsibilities
In case of a nontechnical or strategic decision, a decision regarding a major changes, or a conflict that contributors cannot resolve themselves, (m)otherboard's governing committee has the responsibility for final decision-making.

### Consent to governance
By participating in this community, through collaboration, contribution, adoption, or other activities, you consent to respect the decisions of this community's governance structure.

In addition, you agree to behave in accordance with community values and norms as documented in our Code of Conduct.

## Code of Conduct
We work to maintain and enforce our [code of conduct](https://github.com/EthicalSource/phot-the-mobile-phone/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) fairly and transparently. In case of conflict we prioritize the safety and well-being of those who are most impacted by a violation of our community norms and standards.
