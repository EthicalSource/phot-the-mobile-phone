# A People's History of Tech: The Mobile Phone

This project is managed by the members of the [(m)otherboard](https://m.otherboard.org) organization, in accordance with its [governance structure](https://m.otherboard.org/governance/).

We strive to center the [Ethical Source Principles](https://ethicalsource.dev/principles/) in all the work we do and the decisions we make.

# Decision-making

## Lazy consensus
Most decisions are made in public through comments on pull requests or issues on our Github repository. Decisions about such changes are presumed to pass in the absence of objections from community members.

## Committee responsibilities
In case of major changes, or conflict that contributors cannot resolve themselves, (m)otherboard's governing committee has the responsibility for final decision-making.

# Code of Conduct
We strive for fair and transparent enforcement of our [code of conduct](https://github.com/EthicalSource/phot-the-mobile-phone/blob/release/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and prioritize the safety and well-being of those who are affected by a violation of our community norms and standards.
