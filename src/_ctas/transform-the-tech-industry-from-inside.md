summary: Collective Action School has a grassroots theory of change. We believe
  the people who make the tech industry run—its workers—have the power to not
  only transform it, but to build and imagine new technologies. They welcome all
  tech workers—whether you’re a project manager, warehouse worker, software
  engineer, or ride share driver.
