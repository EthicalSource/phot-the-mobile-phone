Apple acknowledges that they slow down older iPhones through software updates. Apple says this is intended to make the phones' batteries last longer and prevent unexpected shutdowns as batteries age. However, many customers felt misled. Apple apologized and reduced the price for battery replacements, and also added new features to let users see their battery's health and control performance management.

This acknowledgment reignites discussions about planned obsolescence, product longevity, and their contributions to e-waste. The practice of planned obsolescence in the mobile industry raises ethical and environmental concerns about the disposable nature of devices. Companies are often criticized for designing phones that become obsolete quickly, compelling consumers to upgrade.
