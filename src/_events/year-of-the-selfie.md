"Selfie" became the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year. Selfies, or self-portraits taken with mobile phones, became a global phenomenon, influencing pop culture and social media. The rise of smartphones with front-facing cameras made it easy for everyone to take selfies, and social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat helped the form take off. This trend highlighted the power of mobile photography and self-expression in the digital age.
