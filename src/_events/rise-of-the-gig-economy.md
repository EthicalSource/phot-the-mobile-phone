Mobile apps enabled temporary, flexible jobs. Platforms like TaskRabbit and Uber connect freelancers or independent contractors with clients or customers who need a specific service. The entire process, from finding a job, accepting it, completing it, to getting paid, often takes place through the mobile app. Areas include ridesharing, food and parcel delivery, task services, and freelance platforms. Gig workers have struggled with low wages, lack of platform transparency, and job security without benefits or minimum wage protections.
