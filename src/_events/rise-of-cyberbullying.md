Cyberbullying has escalated as more people connect online, affecting many, especially youths. Persistent, invasive, and often anonymous, this form of harassment can occur through texts, apps, and social media, leading to significant emotional distress for victims. 

Cyberbullying was brought to the mainstream after online harassment resulted in multiple teen suicides. For example, an 18-year-old took her own life after her boyfriend sent nude photos of to at least seven other local high schools. After the tragic school shooting at Columbine in 1999, many states in the U.S.  began to pass anti-bullying laws. Some of these laws specifically addressed digital forms of bullying.
