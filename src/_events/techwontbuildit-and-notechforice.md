Movements emerged from the tech community's resistance to certain uses of technology, especially in contexts that may harm vulnerable populations. One of the notable events sparking this movement was Google employees' protest against Project Maven, a Pentagon contract where Google's AI technology would be used to improve drone strike accuracy. After significant internal backlash and resignations, Google decided not to renew the contract and established AI principles to guide future projects. Tech workers and activists also called for tech companies to cease providing technology and software services that might aid ICE in deportations and detentions.
