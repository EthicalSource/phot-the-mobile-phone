The first portable cell phone was invented in 1973 by Motorola. On April 3, 1973, Motorola engineer Martin Cooper made the first-ever cell phone call on the DynaTAC 8000X. The prototype he used weighed 2.4 lb (1.1 kg)  and measured 9.1 x 5.1 x 1.8 in (23 x 13 x 4.5 cm). This clunky device offered a talk time of just 30 minutes and required 10 hours to recharge. Before this, owning a car phone was the closest that one could get to not being tied to a landline. 

The DynaTAC phone was priced at $3,995, equivalent to $10,000 today.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring)
