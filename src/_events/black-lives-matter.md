After the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, three female Black organizers Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi organized the Black Lives Matter movement. The Black Lives Matter movement is a political action committee, a social movement, a slogan, and a Twitter hashtag. Organizers use smartphones to document police brutality and racial injustice, amplifying calls for reform. The killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis was captured on a mobile phone, sparking international protests against police brutality. Throughout these protests, smartphones were essential for documenting, organizing, and amplifying voices.
