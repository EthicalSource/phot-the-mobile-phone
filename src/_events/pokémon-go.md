Pokémon Go's augmented reality mobile game brought virtual and physical worlds together, showcasing the potential of mobile gaming and location-based experiences. Using a smartphone's GPS, players locate, capture, battle, and train virtual creatures called Pokémon, which appear on the screen as if they were in the same real-world location as the player. The game became an instant hit, with millions downloading it within days of its release. It brought AR gaming to the mainstream.

Players have become so engrossed in the game that they are not aware of their surroundings. This has lead to distraction and accidents, such as walking into traffic or trespassing into restricted areas. Players have also reported injuries such as twisted ankles, bruised shins, and other bodily injuries.
