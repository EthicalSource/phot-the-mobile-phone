Popular in the mid-2000s, flash mobs are sudden gatherings of people, often for entertainment or artistic purposes. Organizers usually told participants when and where to meet through text messages or on social media. One of the first flash mobs happened in New York in Macy's department store, when a crowd of about 100 people crowded around a pricy. Participants had been told by organizers, called 'moberators', to pretend they all lived together in a free-love commune and that they wanted to purchase a â€˜love rug.'
