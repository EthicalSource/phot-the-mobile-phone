"Doomscrolling" (or "doomsurfing") refers to the behavior of continuously scrolling through negative, distressing, or alarming news, even though the content may amplify feelings of fear, anxiety, or despair. The term gained traction in 2020, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and other distressing global news events. Journalist Karen K. Ho popularized use of the term in daily tweet reminders to stop doomscrolling.
