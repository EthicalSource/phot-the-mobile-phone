"Doomscrolling" (or "doomsurfing") refers to the act of continuously scrolling through negative, distressing, or alarming news, even though the content may amplify feelings of fear, anxiety, or despair. The term gained significant traction in 2020, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and other concurrent distressing global events."
