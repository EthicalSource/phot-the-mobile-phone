Advocates for the right to repair mobile devices are pushing for legislation that would allow consumers to repair their devices independently. The Right to Repair movement seeks to ensure mobile phone users have access to repair information, tools, and parts. It challenges the standard industry practice of making phones difficult to fix, which often forces users to buy new devices, increasing e-waste and impacting consumer choice and sustainability.

In 2013, grassroots movements started to form in the Digital Right to Repair Coalition, also known as the Repair Association. The organization has led nearly all state legislative efforts in the US and has influenced the formation of similarly focused advocacy groups around the world.
