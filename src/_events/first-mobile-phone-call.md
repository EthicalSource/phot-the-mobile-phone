Did you know the first mobile phone call was a troll? In 1973, Martin Cooper, an engineer at Motorola, used his prototype of the DynaTAC 8000x (the "brick phone") to call his rival engineer at Bell Labs to tell him he was making the first mobile phone call. Standing on Sixth avenue near the Hilton in midtown Manhattan, he said "Joel, this is Marty. I'm calling you from a cell phone, a real handheld portable cell phone."
