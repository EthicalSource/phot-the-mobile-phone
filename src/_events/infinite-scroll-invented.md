Infinite scroll is a design technique used on websites and apps where content continuously loads as the user scrolls down the page or screen. Popular on social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter, the introduction of infinite scroll in mobile apps changed the way users consume content, encouraging continuous scrolling and optimizing for engagement. 

The UX feature is credited to designer Aza Raskin, who suggested it would reduce friction in search results. He suggested to a Google engineer, ""Remove the pagination from the Google search results...good implementation of an non-intrusive infinite scroll."" Raskin went on to found the Center for Humane Technology, and has become an advocate for the ethical use of technology.
