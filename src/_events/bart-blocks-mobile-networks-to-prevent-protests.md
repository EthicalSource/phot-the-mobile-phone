Authorities for Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, blocked wireless signals in certain San Francisco stations in an attempt to prevent protests. Demonstrators had planned to stop trains from running in response to the fatal shooting by BART police on July 3 of Charles Blair Hill, a drunk passenger armed with a knife. BART officials admitted they had switched off the transit system's base stations, disabling its underground wireless network.
