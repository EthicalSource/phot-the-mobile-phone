The "Hey Siri, I'm getting pulled over" shortcut was introduced for iPhones. Activated by voice command, it discreetly records police interactions, sends a location alert to emergency contacts, and stores the video. This innovation reflects growing public desire for accountability in law enforcement encounters. The shortcut was developed by Robert Petersen, who first published it in 2018. Petersen has been updating the program since then, and the shortcut has gained new attention following protests after the police killing of George Floyd.
