The exploitation of cobalt for mobile phone batteries in the Congo has been associated with conflict and human rights abuses, highlighting the ethical concerns in the mobile industry's supply chain. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) mined 69% of the world's cobalt in 2020. The UN declared that the number of internally displaced people had reached a record high of 6.9 million as resurgence of the M23 rebels renders a growing part of the country unsafe for civilians.
