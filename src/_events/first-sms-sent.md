The first SMS text message in history is sent: Neil Papworth, a 22-year-old engineer, uses a personal computer to send the text message “Merry Christmas” via the Vodafone network in the UK to the Orbitel wireless phone of a colleague. By the mid-90s, text messaging becomes a vital tool for communication. The code was auctioned off as an NFT in 2021.
