A study by the Basel Action Network e-Trash Transparency Project revealed that many electronic devices, including mobile phones, are not being recycled responsibly. Some are shipped to developing countries, leading to toxic working conditions. BAN started this project in 2014, by placing 200 small GPS-based tracking devices into old printers and monitors and delivered them to Goodwill and to various recyclers around the country and have continued this work in many regions around the globe.
