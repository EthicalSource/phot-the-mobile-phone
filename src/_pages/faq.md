  alt: Screenshot from a movie scene featuring two men in a kitchen. The man in the foreground is shirtless, wearing a gold necklace, and talking on a cordless phone, with a playful expression. He has a closely cropped haircut. In the background, another man, wearing a black T-shirt with the text 'YES I AM BLACK' in yellow letters, is holding an American football and smiling broadly. The kitchen is wood-paneled with a fridge covered in children's drawings, and the image contains a media player overlay with a play button and a caption that reads 'Show me the money.

### Which people?
We are hoping this becomes a global collective history and storytelling project. But we are early in our own history, and we are iterating and building in public. So we start in the English language. For now…

### Why mobile phones?
Picking one technology to start with was tough. The computers we carry in our pockets are arguably the most intimate and impactful devices we use everyday. Mobile phones seemed like the most accessible and relatable technology to inspire folks to share their direct, personal stories.

### Will there be people’s histories of other technologies?
Yes! We want to explore other inclusive histories of technology. As we grow a community around this project, these will become collective decisions.

### Why histories?
We believe rewriting for a more inclusive history of tech that focuses on people instead of lone founders can help us imagine more equitable and just shared futures.
