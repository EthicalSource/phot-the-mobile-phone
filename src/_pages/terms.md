You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the accuracy, content, or functionality of services provided on or by such third-party websites or businesses, and we do not endorse, nor assume any liability related to your use of, such websites or businesses in any way. 

11.  PROPER USE OF THE SERVICES

13.  FEEDBACK

From time to time, we may ask you for your feedback on the Service. You agree that we may use your feedback, suggestions, or ideas in any way, including in future modifications of the Service, other products or services, advertising or marketing materials. You grant us a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty free license to use the feedback you provide to us in any way.

14.  ASSUMPTION OF RISK

APHOT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (SEE BELOW), AS TO THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ANY USER CONTENT. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

WE ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO MONITOR, EDIT, OR CONTROL THE USER CONTENT THAT YOU OR OTHER USERS POST OR PUBLISH THROUGH THE SERVICE, AND WILL NOT BE IN ANY WAY RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY USER CONTENT ON THE SERVICE.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN USING THE SERVICE, YOU WILL BE EXPOSED TO USER CONTENT FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT USER CONTENT MAY BE INACCURATE, OFFENSIVE, INDECENT OR OBJECTIONABLE. YOU AGREE TO WAIVE, AND DO HEREBY WAIVE, ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE RIGHTS OR REMEDIES YOU HAVE OR MAY HAVE AGAINST APHOT WITH RESPECT TO ANY USER CONTENT. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY USER CONTENT.

15.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; “AS IS”

WE ARE MAKING THE SERVICE AVAILABLE “AS IS” AND, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. YOU ASSUME THE RISK OF ANY AND ALL DAMAGE OR LOSS FROM USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT OPERATION OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.

16.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR LOST DATA, REGARDLESS OF THE FORESEEABILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: ANY CLAIM RELATED TO PERSONAL OR BODILY INJURY IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICE; ANY HARM OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY, OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO, YOUR RELIANCE ON INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE; ANY LOSS OR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF DATA; ANY HARM OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY, OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO, YOUR USE OF OR INTERACTION WITH ANY SERVICES OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE; AND ANY VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, AND OTHER AGREEMENTS. THIS LIMITATION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY OR FORM OF ACTION.

IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS AND YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00).

THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND US.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES OR CAUSES OF ACTION, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

17.  INDEMNIFICATION

In the event that any third party, including without limitation another user, brings a claim against us related to your actions, User Content, or any other use of the Service by you, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us and our agents harmless from and against any and all third-party claims, including privacy violations, losses, liability, damages, and/or costs (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) relating to such claim. We will notify you promptly of any such claim and will provide you with reasonable assistance, at your expense, in defending any such claim, provided, however, that our failure to so notify you shall not relieve you of your indemnity obligations, but instead shall reduce those obligations by the amount of damages or increased costs and expenses attributable to our failure to give notice. We reserve the right to approve counsel retained by you, to take control of the defense (at our expense) of any claim for which indemnity is required, and to participate in the defense of any claim (at our expense) for which indemnity is required. You may not settle any claim without our prior consent.

18.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION

You agree to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy with APHOT arising out of or relating to your use of the Service in the following manner. First, we both agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute informally by contacting each other by email (you can email us at hello@peoplestech.com). Second, if the dispute is not resolved through informal resolution, we both agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute through mediation administered by JAMS, which shall take place in Atlanta, GA, and the costs of which shall be divided equally between you and APHOT. Third, if the dispute is not resolved through informal resolution and mediation, we both agree to participate in binding arbitration administered by JAMS, which shall take place in Atlanta, GA.

Either you or we may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief without first engaging in the dispute resolution process described above.

We both agree that, in the event of arbitration, or in the event of a lawsuit as permitted by this Section or otherwise, the prevailing party shall be entitled to costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees). Arbitration pursuant to this Section shall be confidential, and neither you, nor APHOT, nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement or appeal of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction. There shall be no right or authority for any claims subject to this arbitration clause to be arbitrated on a class action or consolidated basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public (including, but not limited to, as a private attorney general). If any portion of this arbitration clause is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full force and effect.

YOU AND APHOT EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Nothing contained in this Section shall limit our ability to terminate, or otherwise take action related to, your use of the Service as provided in these Terms.

19.  GOVERNING LAW, VENUE, & PERSONAL JURISDICTION

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to conflict of law provisions. In the event that a lawsuit is filed where permitted under the provisions above, or in the event that the provisions above are found not to apply to you or to a given dispute, we both agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the federal or state courts of Fulton County, Georgia. Both you and we consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

20.  SEVERABILITY WAIVER

If, for whatever reason, any term or condition in these Terms is found unenforceable, all other terms and conditions will remain unaffected and in full force and effect. The failure to enforce any provision of these Terms is not a waiver of our right to do so later, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.

21.  CHANGES TO THESE TERMS

APHOT reserves the right to change these Terms from time to time, with or without notice to you. If you continue to use the Service, you consent to the new Terms. Any changes to these Terms will become effective on the “Effective Date” indicated above. If you continue to use the Service after the Effective Date, you consent to the new Terms. APHOT will always have the latest Terms posted on the Service.
