  alt: Screenshot from a movie scene featuring two men in a kitchen. The man in the foreground is shirtless, wearing a gold necklace, and talking on a cordless phone, with a playful expression. He has a closely cropped haircut. In the background, another man, wearing a black T-shirt with the text 'YES I AM BLACK' in yellow letters, is holding an American football and smiling broadly. The kitchen is wood-paneled with a fridge covered in children's drawings, and the image contains a media player overlay with a play button and a caption that reads 'Show me the money.

## We believe that if we collaborate on building a more just and representative history of technology, then we can architect a more just, shared future.

Perhaps no technology has changed our lives more than the mobile phone. And while movies and television show us how the mobile phone has developed, even imagined how it might evolve in the future, we don't get the full story of the true political, social, and economic impacts of carrying a supercomputer in our pockets.

Popular histories of technology often focus on lone inventors or the technical innovations. Here we want to capture the full spectrum of the lived experience of mobile technology. What's missing is the story of you.

A People's History of Tech is a participatory storytelling and technology project that combines the work of experts and historians with popular media and most importantly your stories to gather a dynamic, shared history. We're building in public. Submissions we receive are informing how and what we build together.
