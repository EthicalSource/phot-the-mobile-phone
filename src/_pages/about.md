  alt: Screenshot from a movie scene featuring two men in a kitchen. The man in
    the foreground is shirtless, wearing a gold necklace, and talking on a
    cordless phone, with a playful expression. He has a closely cropped haircut.
    In the background, another man, wearing a black T-shirt with the text 'YES I
    AM BLACK' in yellow letters, is holding an American football and smiling
    broadly. The kitchen is wood-paneled with a fridge covered in children's
    drawings, and the image contains a media player overlay with a play button

## A People’s History of Tech is a collective storytelling project.

Popular histories of technology often focus on lone inventors or technical innovations. Here we want to capture the full spectrum of the lived experience of technology. **What's missing is the story of you.**

You are the storytellers. This is a record of your experience. We’re building in public. Submissions we receive are informing how and what we build together. Together, we are building a living artifact to share and witness the human impacts of technology and harness our power as citizens of the future of tech.

### We believe that if we collaborate on building a more just and representative history of technology, then we can architect a more just, shared future.

Perhaps no technology has changed our lives more than the mobile phone. And while movies and television show us how the mobile phone has developed, even imagined how it might evolve in the future, we don't get the full story of the true political, social, and economic impacts of carrying a supercomputer in our pockets.

## FAQ

### Which people?

We are hoping this becomes a global collective history and storytelling project. But we are early in our own history, and we are iterating and building in public. So we start in the English language. For now…

### Why mobile phones?

Picking one technology to start with was tough. The computers we carry in our pockets are arguably the most intimate and impactful devices we use everyday. Mobile phones seemed like the most accessible and relatable technology to inspire folks to share their direct, personal stories.

### Will there be people’s histories of other technologies?

Yes! We want to explore other inclusive histories of technology. As we grow a community around this project, these will become collective decisions.

### Why histories?

We believe rewriting for a more inclusive history of tech that focuses on people instead of lone founders can help us imagine more equitable and just shared futures.
