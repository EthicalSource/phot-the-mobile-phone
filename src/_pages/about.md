  alt: Screenshot from a movie scene featuring two men in a kitchen. The man in the foreground is shirtless, wearing a gold necklace, and talking on a cordless phone, with a playful expression. He has a closely cropped haircut. In the background, another man, wearing a black T-shirt with the text 'YES I AM BLACK' in yellow letters, is holding an American football and smiling broadly. The kitchen is wood-paneled with a fridge covered in children's drawings, and the image contains a media player overlay with a play button and a caption that reads 'Show me the money.

## A People’s History of Tech is a collective storytelling project.

Popular histories of technology often focus on lone inventors or technical innovations. Here we want to capture the full spectrum of the lived experience of technology. **What's missing is the story of you.**

You are the storytellers. This is a record of your experience. We’re building in public. Submissions we receive are informing how and what we build together. Together, we are building a living artifact to share and witness the human impacts of technology and harness our power as citizens of the future of tech.

### We believe that if we collaborate on building a more just and representative history of technology, then we can architect a more just, shared future.

Perhaps no technology has changed our lives more than the mobile phone. And while movies and television show us how the mobile phone has developed, even imagined how it might evolve in the future, we don't get the full story of the true political, social, and economic impacts of carrying a supercomputer in our pockets.
