response: "\"When I first got a cellphone, I was obsessed. I was 13 and spent
  most of my time texting friends. Over time, I've been working on limiting my
  time on my phone while also appreciating the good it can do for me. Capturing
  a moment between my kids to share with my partner. Reaching out to a friend on
  a bad mental health day. Jotting down a story idea.\""
