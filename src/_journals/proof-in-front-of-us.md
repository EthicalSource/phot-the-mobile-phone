response: '"Watching a genocide happen in real time by Israelis who are funded
  by the US against indigenous Palestinians. Watching body parts and limbs, dead
  babies, children and people on my phone dead and dying, killed by Zionists.
  Watching schools, colleges, AND HOSPITALS invaded and blown up. Watching
  atrocities brought on by Zionists across the world, mainly in Palestine and
  “Israel.” We have proof in front of us thanks to our phones and the
  internet."'
