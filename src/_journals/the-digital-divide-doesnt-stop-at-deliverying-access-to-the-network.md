The important thing to remember is that even if you have a network that's up and running and built, where people can connect to the internet, so many people aren't going to be able to afford devices, so many people don't know how to use devices. So many people feel really intimidated by learning Word and Spreadsheets. Getting on the internet there's fears of safety, which are super valid, data privacy, data sovereignty, and security. Because we know that that banks and institutions love to take advantage of people on reservations and older people, of which we have a lot. So there's all these other factors that implicate digital equity, that broaden the digital divide, that are not necessarily the easiest fixes.
