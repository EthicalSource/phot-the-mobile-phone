prompt: Recall a time you felt vulnerable because of your mobile phone.
response: '"I was the first generation exposed to social media and saw its rise.
  I found myself feeling worse and worse about myself and was constantly
  comparing myself to others by being on those social media apps. After
  observing this about myself, I decided to delete all the apps off of my phone.
  I have found myself not regretting the decision at all."'
