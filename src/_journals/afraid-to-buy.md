response: "\"I was originally afraid to buy a smartphone - and slower to
  purchasing one - because I didn't want it to absorb too much of my focus. I
  was afraid that having always-on access to the web, social media, etc. would
  be a problem for me. Now that I have a smartphone, I have to be very
  intentional about how/when I use it, and catch myself if I default to using it
  to fill the gaps in between more intentional activities.\""
