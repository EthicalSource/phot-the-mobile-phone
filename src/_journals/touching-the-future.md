response: >-
  "I remember the first time I sent a “BBM” through my BlackBerry. The thought
  that I could instant message someone directly in my phone while away from my
  computer opened up my mind to the powerful potential of the mobile phone. 


  "Similarly I remember the first time I saw an iPhone and it looked like they had shrunk the browser right into the phone instead of the distorted view I was used to on BlackBerry. It truly blew my mind that I could just click the browser. I felt like I was touching the future. (And in many ways, I was!)"
