Recall a time you felt vulnerable because of your mobile phone: 

## “Location sharing with my friends and partners is usually something that makes me feel safer—but it is shadowed by a memory of my earliest location-sharing experience. In college, in 2002, my ex-boyfriend used our computer network to show up at my new girlfriend's apartment, where he could see I had logged in. He screamed obscenities at us, and I have been aware that my phone makes me even more vulnerable to oversight of my location."
