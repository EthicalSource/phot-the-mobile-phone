response: '"During peak COVID, my beloved grandma passed away abroad (of old
  age). It was so hard not to be able to be at her funeral, which was only a
  band of close relatives due to the virus, but my cousin had the foresight to
  take a brief video of the ceremony and we got to speak to our relatives who
  were there, and that made it just a bit easier. We felt we, too, were there,
  in a small way."'
