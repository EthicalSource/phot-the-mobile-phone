prompt: Describe a time when your mobile phone made you feel powerful.
response: "\"One click. That's all it takes to send a letter to my member of
  parliament on the causes closest to my heart. Before getting more deeply
  involved with lobbying in parliamentarian offices, federal offices, and
  working side-by-side with national levels of government to introduce,
  advocate, and lobby for the passing of certain bills and legislations, it
  began with my mobile phone. Sending pre-written letters via email or by text
  to my local representatives via websites of the largest non-profit advocacy
  groups. My mobile phone empowered me to take part in these simple
  opportunities available to anyone for what would make a difference to
  everyone.\""
