response: "\"My first cell phone was the Nokia 3310. I got it in 1999, and I
  remember being so excited for Snake and texting, lol. I loved the size and
  heaviness of the phones back then, because due to my disability and limited
  dexterity, they were so much easier to hold and they NEVER broke... this is
  true. And I can't say the same for iPhones in 2024.\""
