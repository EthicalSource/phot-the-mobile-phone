Share a significant moment in your life that involved a mobile phone: 

## â€œMy maternal unit bought a PALM Pilot when it was released '97 and learned a whole new language.* It both inspired and shamed me into inviting personal communication tech into my life. 

## \*She was in her 70's at the time. We can ALWAYS learn new things."
