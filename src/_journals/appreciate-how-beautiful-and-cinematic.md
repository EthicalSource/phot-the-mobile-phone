How has your phone changed your relationship to your environment? 

## â€œI used to make mixed CDs on my computer in high school and listen to a walkman on my walks to and from school, and then I got an iPod Shuffle. And then my phone could play music on its own, and my whole world changed. I love walking in my town and building playlists - it helps me appreciate how beautiful and cinematic nature and my community can be."
