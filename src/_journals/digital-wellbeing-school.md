response: "\"I used to be that person who couldn't do without seeing my mobile
  phone for a second. But that has changed over the months. When I discovered
  this relationship I had with my phone was toxic after graduating from a
  digital wellbeing school. This school helped me redefine my relationship with
  my phone. I learnt to love my phone but not in away that hurts my wellbeing.
  Today I balance my time and life when it comes to my phone use.\""
