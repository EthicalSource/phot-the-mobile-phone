prompt: Describe a time when your mobile phone made you feel powerful.
response: "\"When I was in high school, I had a very long commute. It felt
  powerful how I could write essays on my smartphone during train rides and
  buses; down time when I couldn't do much else. It's funny how this access to
  my work at anytime, is now something I try to avoid in my daily life. My
  commutes are for me now, to learn, to breathe, to do other than produce for
  others.\""
