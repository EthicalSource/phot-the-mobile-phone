response: When I first got a Nokia, it helped while away time when waiting to
  play Tetris. Now, my various phone apps have become like a friend and
  confidante helping me to navigate the challenges of life and being a place
  where I can sift through my ideas before sharing with the outside world. I can
  definitely say that I've become dependent on my phone for more than mere
  entertainment during my down time.
