response: WHEN TRAVELING TO THE ATACAMA DESERT IN CHILE, WE NOTICED POSTERS WITH
  A PHOTO OF AN INDIGENOUS WARRIOR THAT READ ""YOU WILL DRINK LITHIUM YOU WILL
  EAT COPPER"" PROTESTING THE EXTRACTION OF THESE METALS THAT WERE SUCKING THE
  LAND DRY IN AN ALREADY WATER SCARCE PLACE. THE LOCALS HAD BOYCOTTED CELL PHONE
  USE TO UNDERSCORE THEIR PLIGHT.
