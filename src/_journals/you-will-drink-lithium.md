## When traveling to the Atacama Desert in Chile we noticed posters with a photo of an indigenous warrior that read “You will drink lithium. You will eat copper.” protesting the extraction of these metals that were sucking the land dry in an already water scarce place. The locals had boycotted cell phone use to underscore their plight.
