response: '"When I received my first mobile phone, it felt like an entryway to
  an entire new universe of people and thoughts. I quickly began to spend much
  of my time exploring many forms of content on the internet, hooked by the
  amount and size of different communities. At the swipe of a finger I could
  drift among an endless echo of my own opinions, or delve into unfruitful and
  at times toxic discussions with anons on less commonly visited forums. Reddit,
  Twitter ("X"), Instagram and YouTube were some of the apps with a firm grasp
  on my attention. Nowadays, I find myself moving away from the hyper-speed of
  online media and looking for more face-to-face interactions and discussions,
  and the use of my phone reflects that as well."'
