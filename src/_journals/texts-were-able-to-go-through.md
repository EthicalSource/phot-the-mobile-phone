response: "\"9/11/2001. Iâ€™m stuck in Toronto at the film festival. No NY area
  code (routed) cell phones are working. I had a brand new Nokia 8260 and had
  already discovered a 'text message' feature which I had previously used to
  surprise friends. No service providers had text plans yet, or was in testing
  mode. On that fateful day, I tried texting friends and lo and behold, texts
  were able to go through. I taught other friends to see if their phones could
  also send texts. Before 9/11 none of them knew about texting.\""
