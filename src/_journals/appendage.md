response: "\"I got my first mobile phone before many of my peers. It worked
  similar to a landline (which we were used to), but I was able to call my mom
  in an emergency. Over time, my phone has become a lifeline, an appendage. I
  think that change largely hinged on data. I became attached when I was
  tracking step count or work hours data. Now I am breastfeeding and tracking my
  babyâ€™s sleep and can't even move room to room in my house without it.\""
