  of technology, and harnessing our joint power for the future of tech
  citizenship. Our journey begins with the mobile phone, a pocket-sized marvel
  that has transformed our relationship with time, space and each other. How did
  we get here? Weâ€™ve seeded the timeline with key events and critical voices.
  Explore themes and [personal histories](/collections/peoples-stories), [add
